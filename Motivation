Climate change is the group of changes made on the Earth by humans in the last century.
Contrary to what many people think, climate change isn’t only the increase in the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and global heating: it is also the loss of biodiversity, the acidification of oceans… 
The causes for these changes are many: in first place, the use of fossil fuels in industry and transport, the deforestation and the loss of species it entails; among others.

The consequences of all these changes are even more: every year, there are more typhoons, hurricanes and storms, summers get hotter, ice caps melt, droughts begin and don’t end, hectares of forests burn, the sea level rises, species disappear, just to name some of the countless ways we are destroying our planet.
It has been millions of years since the Earth changed like it is changing right now, and it changed in hundreds of thousands of years. In the span of a hundred years, we’ve managed to raise its average temperature by 1.5ºC.

Luckily, life won’t completely extinguish: some species will adapt, and in millions of years, life will thrive again. But humans will not be able to adapt. So if you don’t want to stop climate change for polar bears and primates, stop it for humans.
